if you want resizable div,
simply add width 100%, and set a max width.


you can center div using margin auto
or better yet, place-items: center

design mobile first for less hassle, see catalog css

css transition is pretty cool, see catalog css

backblaze only uploads img if exact file size is provided, see products controller for method

formidable makes extracting img from form easier, doesnt work with body-parser or something

to have consistent footer, make main body a flexbox, add margin top auto and bottom 0 to footer

use fetch for frontend requests, use http for backend requests

SET condition = condition + 1, is a thing in sql update

dont put await inside a console.log, ffs

Theres more I learnt that I don't recall right now,
documentation should cover most of the app

you can store file buffers in a DB, but i guess DBs arent that efficent?
I'd still use a bucket because thats what people do, for experience
